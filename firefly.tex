\begin{abstract}
This document's purpose is to serve as a meeting place for discussion of
the second version of the Firefly's user interface. The specification here
should separate itself from the hardware implementation of the microscope
and tie itself more closely to the user experience. The user thinks in terms
stimulus patterns, cells, and their electrical waveforms, so the initial 
discussion will involve an abstract specification of the experimental configuration 
that allows the user to experience the Firefly as a biological oscilliscope 
and function generator. The second part of the document will include a more 
in depth exploration of the parameter space and investigate how to 
abstractly and concretely represent the configuration of a particular 
experiment. The conclusions drawn here will shape the both the user 
experience and how the front-end interface interacts with the underlying 
control system.
