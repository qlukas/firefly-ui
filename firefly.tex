\begin{abstract}
This document's purpose is to serve as a meeting place for discussion of
the second version of the Firefly's user interface. The specification here
should separate itself from the hardware implementation of the microscope
and tie itself more closely to the user experience. The user thinks in terms
stimulus patterns, cells, and their electrical waveforms, so the initial 
discussion will involve an abstract specification of the experimental configuration 
that allows the user to experience the Firefly as a biological oscilliscope 
and function generator. The second part of the document will include a more 
in depth exploration of the parameter space and investigate how to 
abstractly and concretely represent the configuration of a particular 
experiment. The conclusions drawn here will shape the both the user 
experience and how the front-end interface interacts with the underlying 
control system.

\section{Vision: Firefly as a Biological Function Generator and Oscilliscope}
\subsection{Region Selection}
Each region will be contained within the current field of view. 
There will be three ways to define regions:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Choose a preset region.
 \item Define a custom region by clicking on the current field of view.
 \item Use a segmentation algorithm to generate regions.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Preset Regions and Patterns}
Preset regions will include the full field of view and user generated masks.
\subsubsection{User-Defined and Algorithmically-Segmented Regions}
The user will either click on the field of view to select a region or run a 
segmentation algorithm. The user will be able to perform the following 
operations on a region once it has been placed in a field of view:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Resize
  \item Reshape
  \item Drag around the field of view
  \item Delete
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Regions as Sources and Probes}
Each region abstractly represents a part of a circuit accessible to a signal
generator or oscilliscope probe. A user designates a region as a Stimulus Region,
Record Region, or both.
\subsection{Stimulus Pattern Generation}
For each region designated as a Stimulus Region, the user can specify a pattern
of stimulation. The user specifies stimulus patterns by selecting among
pre-defined stimulus waveforms.
\subsection{Electrical Waveform Monitor}
For each region designated as a Record Region, the user can specify an algorithm
for live analysis and monitoring. The user specifies the monitor algorithm by 
selecting among pre-defined options.
